# Eniac A/B Testing Project

## Summary
This project focuses on conducting A/B testing on different versions of webpage buttons to determine which version yields the highest click-through rate (CTR). The buttons tested include variations in color and call-to-action text. The analysis is carried out using a Jupyter Notebook, and the results are visualized to identify the most effective button version.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - re (regular expressions)
  - scipy.stats (for chi-square test)
  - plotly (for data visualization)
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Git
  - GitHub

## Key Learnings
- **Technical Skills**: 
  - Conducting A/B testing to compare different versions of webpage elements.
  - Using pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Applying statistical tests (chi-square test) to determine the significance of results.
  - Visualizing data with Plotly to highlight key findings.
- **Communication Skills**:
  - Documenting the project effectively to communicate the findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
  - Visualizing the results in an intuitive manner to make the insights easily understandable.

## Challenges Overcame
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - Extracting and processing relevant data from the provided CSV files.
  - Handling data to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Applying the chi-square test to determine the statistical significance of the differences in CTR among the button versions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Creating effective visualizations to clearly present the results of the A/B test.
  - Highlighting the winning version in the visualization to make it stand out.

## Additional Reflections
- The project reinforced the importance of statistical analysis in making data-driven decisions. Understanding the statistical significance of the results ensured that the conclusions drawn were based on solid evidence.
- Communicating the findings through visualizations and documentation was crucial in making the insights accessible to a broader audience, including those who may not have a technical background.
- Future work could involve testing additional variations or conducting similar analysis on different webpage elements to further optimize user engagement and conversion rates.
